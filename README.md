# AI/ML Mask Detection Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a real-time mask detection system using TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. The primary goal is to develop a robust solution capable of identifying whether a person in a live video stream is wearing a mask or not.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher)
- TensorFlow (2.x)
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Numpy

You can install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy
```

## Dataset

To train and evaluate your mask detection model, you'll need a dataset containing images of people with and without masks. You can collect or use an existing dataset like the [Kaggle Face Mask Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection).

## Model Development

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the images.

2. **Model Architecture**: Choose or design a suitable deep learning model for mask detection. A popular choice is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

3. **Model Training**: Train the model on the prepared dataset. Use binary classification techniques as mask detection is a binary problem.
  
   

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a validation dataset.

6. **Model Fine-tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters and optimize the model if necessary.

7. **Model Serialization**: Save the trained model for later use in real-time detection.

## Real-time Detection

1. **Camera Integration**: Capture a live video stream from a camera using OpenCV.

2. **Frame Processing**: Preprocess each frame (resize, normalize) to match the model's input requirements.

3. **Inference**: Pass the processed frame through the trained model for mask detection.

4. **Overlay**: Draw bounding boxes or labels on the frame to indicate whether a person is wearing a mask or not.

5. **Display**: Show the processed frames in real-time with the detection results.

## Running the Project

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-mask-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd face-mask-detection   ```

3. Run the real-time detection script:

   ```bash
   detect_mask_video.py
   ```

## Questions to Consider

1. What is the target hardware for deploying this system (e.g., Raspberry Pi, GPU server)?
2. Have you considered privacy concerns related to video surveillance?
3. How will you handle cases where people wear masks improperly (e.g., below the nose)?
4. Are you planning to integrate this system with any alerting or notification mechanisms?
5. What is the expected frame rate for real-time processing, and can your hardware support it?
6. Have you considered any legal or ethical implications regarding the use of this system?
